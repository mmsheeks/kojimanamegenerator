## Kojima Name Generator

This is an open source clone of the [PDF worksheet](https://www.polygon.com/videos/2019/11/11/20959269/unraveled-kojima-name-generator-death-stranding) put together by [Polygon](https://polygon.com) and [Brian David Gilbert](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCakAg8hC_RFJm4RI3DlD7SA) that answers the eternal question, "If I was a Hideo Kojima character, what would my name be?"

### Credits
All credit for the original generator to BDG and Polygon.

Credit to [@Twittermancer](https://www.twitter.com/twittermancer) and [@PapaRoebuck](https://www.twitter.com/PapaRoebuck) for pointing out a bug in the original code that made the generator forget your "Old" condition.

Application built using [Laravel](https://www.laravel.com) and [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) because I'm too lazy to write code in pure PHP these days.
